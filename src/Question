Given a grid of square cells, each of the cells is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated".
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
At each step in time, the following transitions occur: \

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies as if caused by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The requirement of the coding exercise:
Given a 200*200 matrix and the coordinates of initial live cells, please implement a program to output the next 100 state according to Conway's Game of Life.
Left top corner with [0, 0] and right bottom corner with [199, 199].eg.
intput: {{}}
Output of the next 100 state:
1: []
intput: [[5, 5], [6, 5], [7, 5], [5, 6], [6, 6], [7, 6]]
Output of the next 100 state:
1: [[5, 5], [6, 4] [7, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 6]]
2: [[5, 5], [6, 4] [7, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 6]]
3: [[5, 5], [6, 4] [7, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 6]]
